In the folder search examples, there are file examples with content like countries and fruits.
There is also a folder containing a large number of files that all start with 'This is file X'.
They can be searched for to test the scrollbars.
File content results are sorted by number of matches (high to low).

In this file's directory there should be 2 other files plus the search examples folder to make searching easier in this directory.
To search in this directory and test the examples, check the 'Include current directory' checkbox before searching.
To search in a different directory simply input it in one of the entries.

All error cases from non-existing directories to missing or invalid keywords are taken into consideration.
